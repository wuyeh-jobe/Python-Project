The process of calculating the total amount of money a customer has to pay has become a problem for many shop keepers in rural Gambia. Coupled with this is the problem of writing a receipt for their customers, which they often neglect because it consumes time and resources. These problems have led many shop keepers to lose a substantial amount of money due to miscalculations, and also leads to arguments with customers who feel they have been cheated. This program seeks to address this issue in a unique way. Apart from calculating the amount of money to be paid, it gives you an idea of the items available, their prices, and quantities.
